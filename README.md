## 4. Imagery & Visual Style

Imagery and visual assets should consistently reinforce the **CONCORDIA CASH** brand values, conveying professionalism, innovation, clarity, and approachability.

### 4.1 Photography Principles
- **Style:** Authentic, modern, and optimistic. Avoid overly staged or generic stock photos. Focus on natural lighting and clean compositions.
- **Subject Matter:** Depict concepts like secure transactions, global connectivity, community interaction, and the positive impact of financial technology. Images of people interacting with technology or abstract representations of secure networks are preferred.
- **Color Tone:** Photography should generally align with the brand's primary and secondary color palette, featuring natural lighting and clear compositions to maintain visual harmony.

### 4.2 Illustration & Iconography
- **Style:** Clean, geometric, and minimalist. Line art or flat design illustrations are preferred. Icons should be simple, intuitive, and instantly recognizable. The style should echo the precision of the logo and Montserrat typeface.
- **Color:** Primarily use Concordia Green and Concordia White. Limited and intentional use of secondary colors (Concordia Blue, Grey, Accent Gold) is permissible for emphasis or categorization, ensuring they do not overpower the primary palette.
- **Consistency:** All icons and illustrations should belong to a unified set, maintaining consistent stroke weights, corner radii, and overall visual language to ensure a cohesive visual system.
